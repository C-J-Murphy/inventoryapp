# inventoryapp

The inventory app is a porject I am developing for my Management of Technological Classes course. The course goal is to create and develop an application to sell to businesses. Our group decided to create a simple inventory management application for small restaurants whose chefs are burdened by the pen and paper process of inventory management. 

The applications design uses html and css built on Bootstrap. The front end is built with Javascript(Jquery) and the backend is managed with PHP and MySql.
